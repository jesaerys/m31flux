    increases with decreasing observed flux, suggesting that the uncertainties
    are dominated by incomplete IMF sampling. The large red circles represent
    flux ratios for the UV-bright regions from \citet{Simones:2014} and are

    distribution for the flux ratios, with the most severely overestimated and
